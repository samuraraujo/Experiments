# This example demonstrates how to use a_star.rb with a network of connected
# points, like a street map or train route map. It also makes use of movement
# costs: weights are assigned to the network's connections. In the street map
# analogy, one might think of the weights as being inversely related to speed
# limits.
#
# The network created by the example looks like this:
#
#  A----B
#  |   / \
#  |  F   C
#  |     /
#  E----D
#
# The example finds paths from A to F and from A to C. The path from A to C
# will go through E and D, not B, because a high cost is assigned to the
# connection between B and C.
